# install

`npm install coinstac-example-computation-bisect-converge`

# what

this is an example coinstac decentralized computation.

this example does not perform a meaningful analysis.  instead, it exercises the coinstac system behavior and network utilities.

this particular example algorithm performs the following:

- a series of users guess a random integers between 0 and 100
- after the first user makes his/her guess, the coinstac central computation server selects a random number from the same range
- on every response from the server, each client selects a value exactly halfway between his/her last guess and the value the central server selected
- once a user's value is within 10% of the server's selected value, the server considers that user to be "converged."
  - interestingly, each user will continue to get closer and closer to the server's value (asymptotically) while his/her peers still progress to conversion.

# why

it's a good starting point for new coinstac developers to see how coinstac operates.

# when

now.

# who

you, your computer, and your pal, the internet.

# how

see #install and #run

# run

`coinstac-simulator -d ./test/declaration.js`, or!, `npm test`
